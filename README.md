# Docker
** We need to first create the ec2 instance and install the Docker on that EC2 machine once install we need to provide the user in the user group were we have freely use the docker without using of the docker command, below are the command:**

sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

## Check user was added or not:
sudo cat /etc/group
docker:x:992:ec2-user


**Some are commands important for the Docker:**
docker images ls ‚Äìa >> Docker images View

docker container >>View all container

docker system ‚Äìhelp >>to check the Systeam information

docker image pull hello-world  >> pulling image

docker container run hello-world >> create the container and run that

-a, --attach list                      Attach to STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR

-d, --detach                     Run container in background and print container ID

-e, --env list                         Set environment variables 

-i, --interactive                      Keep STDIN open even if not attached

-m, --name string                      Assign a name to the container

-p, --publish list                     Publish a container's port(s) to the host

-t, --tty                              Allocate a pseudo-TTY


### Command for generating the container:
docker image pull httpd

docker container run --name websrever -d -i -t -p 7000:80 httpd

docker container stop webserver  >> Stop the container 

docker container start webserver >> Start the container

docker container inspect webserver >> for detail for the image and container

docker container exec -it websrever /bin/bash >> execute the container

Path for changes >>> cd htdocs/


## How to create the images and run as containerization?
-First you need to login the EC2 instance where you have install Docker:

-Now Creating the directory in the Docker server 

-Under the docker we can create the file name image, where we clone the git resposrity of the python pogram

# Dockerfile Keywords Guide

This document provides a basic overview of commonly used Dockerfile instructions. A Dockerfile is a simple text file containing predefined, case-sensitive keywords used to build custom Docker images.

---

## üê≥ Common Dockerfile Instructions

| Keyword      | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **FROM**      | Specifies the base image from which the Docker image is created. |
| **MAINTAINER**| Represents the name of the organization or author who created the Dockerfile. *(Deprecated in favor of `LABEL`)* |
| **CMD**       | Defines the default command that will run when the container starts. |
| **ENTRYPOINT**| Sets the default application to be executed inside the container. It also allows arguments to be passed from the `CMD` instruction. |
| **RUN**       | Executes commands in the container during the image build process. Commonly used to install software packages. |
| **USER**      | Specifies the default user to use when running the image. |
| **WORKDIR**   | Sets the working directory inside the container. |
| **COPY**      | Copies files and directories from the host machine to the container. |
| **ADD**       | Similar to `COPY`, but also supports downloading files from URLs and unpacking compressed files. |
| **ENV**       | Sets environment variables inside the container. |
| **EXPOSE**    | Indicates which port the container listens on at runtime. |
| **VOLUME**    | Creates a mount point with a specified path and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from the native host or other containers. |
| **LABEL**     | Adds metadata to an image, such as a version or description. |
| **STOPSIGNAL**| Defines the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit gracefully. |

## üìù Example Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04
MAINTAINER example@example.com
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
COPY ./index.html /var/www/html/
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]


-While creating the image we require the one text file which is help us to execute the command

-so creating the text file inside same path ‚ÄúDockerfile‚Äù
